`boa-datagen` is a library which converts from Java ASTs represented using the
[Sun Compiler Tree API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/jdk/api/javac/tree/overview-summary.html)
to equivalent Java ASTs represented by the [Boa Project's](http://boa.cs.iastate.edu/)
[protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)-based AST format.

In the future, the scope of this library may expand to include many other aspects of Boa data generation.
